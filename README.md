Atliq Hardware Data Analytics Challenge using SQL

**Atliq Hardware**

**Introduction**

Welcome to the Atliq Hardware Data Analytics Challenge repository! This project showcases my journey through a SQL challenge presented by Atliq Hardware, a prominent computer hardware manufacturer. The challenge aimed to harness data for informed decisions and fortify the data analytics team with junior analysts. I'll take you through my approach and the tools I used, as well as the key learnings from this experience.

**The Challenge**

Atliq Hardware faced a critical challenge - the need to make data-driven decisions. To address this, Tony Sharma, the head of data analytics, organized a SQL challenge that required a combination of technical prowess and soft skills. The goal was to navigate complex data and present actionable insights.

**Approach and Tools**
In this challenge, I used the following tools and techniques:

**MySQL**: I utilized MySQL to query the database and extract valuable information.

**Power BI and Excel**: To craft visual narratives from the data, I combined the power of Power BI and Excel to transform raw numbers into compelling visuals.

**Canva**: Exploring Canva's design features, I enhanced the impact of my insights by creating visually appealing presentations.

**Key Learnings**

**SQL Empowerment**

**Subqueries**: I learned to use subqueries to break down complex problems and access specific data within the database.

**Multiple Joins**: Utilizing multiple joins, I connected data from different tables to generate comprehensive insights.

**Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: CTEs helped me simplify complex queries and make them more readable.

**Window Functions**: I employed window functions to perform calculations on subsets of data, enabling me to derive valuable insights.

**Visual Intelligence**

**Power BI and Excel Fusion**: The integration of Power BI and Excel allowed me to create stunning visualizations, enabling me to uncover trends and patterns within the data.

**Design Impact**: With Canva, I learned how to design and present data in a visually appealing and effective manner, enhancing the overall impact of my insights.
